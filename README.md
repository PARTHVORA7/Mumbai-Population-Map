## Data Source

Census 2011: [http://censusindia.gov.in/pca/pcadata/pca.html](http://censusindia.gov.in/pca/pcadata/pca.html)

There is sub-ward level data available on the census website for Mumbai and Mumbai Suburban. These two datasets were collated and then the data was grouped by wards. 
The original dataset does not have Ward Names ('A', 'B', 'F/S' etc.) as used everywhere by the BMC. 

This information was extracted by following the directions here: [https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!searchin/datameet/ward$20mumbai/datameet/AG3hO7cn3VU/4lmdFlNxCAAJ](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!searchin/datameet/ward$20mumbai/datameet/AG3hO7cn3VU/4lmdFlNxCAAJ)

    Rithika,

    You can take a look at the sequence given in the Census Handbook [page 10].

    Hey Sumit!

    Just a quick qn, what do we do in case of wards such as M ward, where there is an M East and M West and similar such cases. So will we take the M E before M W because of the alphabetical order. thanks!!

    The first two digits of the ward number given in the Census dataset will match with the BMC's alphabetical list.

    Hello, 

    I work with a Mumbai based research institute and we are interested in doing some ward level analysis based on Mumbai. 

    I've downloaded the Primary census abstract which has ward level info on household amenities. However I see that the wards are identified as nos. eg. 1048 or 0835 etc. Wards as I understand, in the BMC are identified as A / B/ M west etc. Any idea if there is a one to one mapping of the census ward numbers to the BMC ward alphabets? 

    Any help will be appreciated! Thank you! :)
