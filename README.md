## Data Source

Census 2011: [http://censusindia.gov.in/pca/pcadata/pca.html](http://censusindia.gov.in/pca/pcadata/pca.html)

There is sub-ward level data available on the census website for Mumbai and Mumbai Suburban. These two datasets were collated and then the data was grouped by wards. 
The original dataset does not have Ward Names ('A', 'B', 'F/S' etc.) as used everywhere by the BMC. This information was extracted by following the directions here: [https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!searchin/datameet/ward$20mumbai/datameet/AG3hO7cn3VU/4lmdFlNxCAAJ](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!searchin/datameet/ward$20mumbai/datameet/AG3hO7cn3VU/4lmdFlNxCAAJ)
